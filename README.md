# Dermatological-Image-Classifier-CNN-Transfer-Learning-Google-Cloud
This project involves the development of a deep learning-based image classification system to detect and categorize dermatological conditions from medical images. The core objective is to assist early diagnosis by automatically classifying skin diseases using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning techniques.
